## üåê General Information

The project aims to create a simple, cost-effective, and accessible system for automatic monitoring and control of the microclimate for plant cultivation in homes or backyard greenhouses. 
The system is designed to use inexpensive and readily available components. 
The current version of the system and software allows for data collection from individual sensors such as soil moisture, light intensity, and air temperature and humidity. 
The system enables climate control through the activation of specific actuators directly affecting the environment/microclimate of the cultivation - the decision-making process uses the collected data applying appropriate data filtering mechanisms. 
The system allows data accumulation in the InfluxDB database, facilitating easy integration with the 'Grafana' tool for visualizing the collected data.

## üíª Software Setup

### Technologies

#### Central Unit:
- Ubuntu 22.04

- InfluxDB (Optional)
- Grafana (Optional)

#### Display Module:
- C++

### Central Unit:
1. Install the Ubuntu 22.04 operating system on the Raspberry Pi device (Core version recommended).
2. On the Raspberry Pi, install Python version 3.10:
   ```sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3.10```
3. Install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
4. ___Optionally__ - Install and configure the [InfluxDB](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/install/?t=Linux) database and [Grafana](https://grafana.com)<br> (w pliku `GrafanaPanelExample.json` umieszczono przyk≈ÇadowƒÖ konfiguracjƒô panelu grafany)._

### Display Module:
1. Download [ArduinoIDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Connect the Arduino UNO device to the computer using a USB serial interface.
3. Upload the `ArduinoDisplayModule.ino` file using [ArduinoIDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)


## üöÄ Start-up

1. Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/arturklimek/smart-green.git```
2. Start the software: ```python3 ./main.py```

It is recommended to run the software as a system service by creating and deploying an appropriate `.service` file.

__NOTE__: Operating the system in harsh conditions requires the development and application of a suitable enclosure and protection for the system components.


## ‚öô Configuration

The default configuration includes four types of sensors (one of each), three actuators, and three controllers.
<br>
Adjust the software configuration to your needs by modifying the `config.yaml` file.

- The `influxdb` section contains information on the InfluxDB database used for storing sensor data:
  - `host` - the database server address (default: `localhost`)
  - `port` -  the database port (default: `8086`)
  - `username` - the username used for writing data (default: `garden_core_user`)
  - `password` - the password used for writing data
  - `database` - the name of the database (default: `garden`)
- The `sensors` section lists the sensors and their configuration, each containing:
  - `name` - a unique name for each sensor
  - `type` - the type of sensor, options include: `TemperatureSensor`, `HumiditySensor`, `SoilMoistureSensor`, `LightSensor`
  - `params` - the sensor's configuration parameters
    - `read_frequency` - the data collection frequency in seconds
    - `pin` -  the GPIO pin designation (for `TemperatureSensor` or `HumiditySensor` only)
    - `i2c_address` - the I2C address of the sensor (for `SoilMoistureSensor` or `LightSensor` only)
- The `actuators` section lists the actuators and their configuration, each containing:

- The `controllers` section lists the controllers and their configuration, each containing:
  - `type` - the type of controller, options include: `IrrigationController`, `VentilationController`, `LightingController`
  - `sensors` - the list of sensors whose data are used to control the actuator, each identified by the sensor's name and containing its configuration:
    - `threshold` - the value at which the actuator is activated
    - `comparison` - determines whether activation is triggered by exceeding the value upwards or downwards, options: `HIGHER` lub `LOWER`
  - `actuator` - specifies the actuator controlled by the controller, identified by its unique name
  - `params` - the controller's configuration parameters
    - `check_interval` - the frequency of controller operation in seconds
    - `cooldown_period` - the minimum time in seconds that must elapse between activations

### üìå Additional Information
The program has a built-in logging mechanism; in case of operational issues, debugging the software by analyzing the entries saved in the `./logs` directory is recommended.

### üí° Project Genesis
The project was initiated and designed as part of an engineering thesis. The system was built using physical components and was tested. The entire process of designing and creating the basic version of the system is detailed in the engineering thesis, titled 'Automatic garden control and monitoring system - designing and implementing a system, intelligent garden management tools.'

During the project development, a prototype was created, and test data were collected under real usage conditions. The collected data underwent thorough analysis, leading to the implementation of data filtering mechanisms in the software, including anomaly detection and appropriate decision-making mechanisms based on average values. In the project development process, the test data were also compared with external sources, highlighting the importance of proper sensor placement and protection against external atmospheric influences.

### üîç Improvement concepts:

- Development of an enclosure for the system
- Development of proper sensor placement
- Protection of the soil moisture sensor against excessive corrosion
- Introduction of support for a wider variety of sensors
- Introduction of support for multiple sensors of the same type and the ability to make decisions based on data from a group of sensors
- Implementation of power supply from a 230V installation/emergency power supply + solar panel power
